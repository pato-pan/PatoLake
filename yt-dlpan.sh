### nameformat choices explanation: 100 characters for video title and 20 for channel name in my opinion is long enough. The max for a channel name on youtube is 50. Linux limits by bytes rather than characters, so highest value is used since fonts and foreign characters occupy more than 1 byte, it prevents a title that's shorter than desired.
#nameformat="%(title)s - %(uploader)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s" # flaw: Doesn't account for OS filename length limitation
#nameformat="%(title).100s - %(uploader).50s [%(id)s].%(ext)s" # Flaw: Windows only, otherwise perfect. In Linux, it will fail with long filenames. 255 is the max limit for Windows, I think 100 is long enough
nameformat="%(title)+.176B - %(uploader).50B [%(id)s].%(ext)s" # Flaw: Special fonts and japanese will be shorter than expected. This is way over 100 to account for japanese characters.
#nameformat="%(title)+.50U - %(uploader).50B [%(id)s].%(ext)s" # Flaw: Smaller titles, removes special fonts, chance of failure with japanese. I played with this for a bit, it's a bit too annoying.
