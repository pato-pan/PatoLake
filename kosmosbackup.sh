# You will likely never see a public version of my backup script.
# It's filled with way too many things that are inappropriate, but if I do I have to keep the memes and nonsense because they had become essential for defining the script and even add more educational value.
# It became a dependency.
# I want to share because I wish more people did external backups like me. I also wish people stopped thinking "let's do an internal backup, there we go! moving on!" when I find internal backups to be very unreliable
# they don't account for hardware failure which is the most likely threat to me. Only dumb mistakes and viruses. I never deal with this, I have snapshots and I never rollback. External is the only true way.
# I had also achieved peak enlightment from turning this external storage into what's responsible for backing up my entire environment. Every device around me is backed up from this.
# This script I feel like could be educational, but it would be much better if it pushed others to take the same approach as me.
# I mean, this easily wins for being more attractive and fun.
# The others are boring, quick one-liners, incomplete, etc. It's not bad, a lot of my scripts are like that, I am just saying that this is more appealing and this is how it stands out.
